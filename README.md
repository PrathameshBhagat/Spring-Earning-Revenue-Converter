# Spring Earning/Revenue Converter
A basic Spring Boot Project to convert earnings into various currencies was intended to help OFY Wellness but was put on hold due to the higher priority of the OFY Wellness Android app.  
# Downloads
You can download the executable files from [this](https://github.com/PrathameshBhagat/Spring-Earning-Revenue-Converter/releases/tag/0.0.1) release.
# Converter running on an AWS EC2 instance

# Progress
As of now, it relies on stored currency exchange data instead of live currency rates from a third-party API, which will soon be updated.  
The converter currently needs to be downloaded via a jar file locally and isn't available on the EC2 instance via a link directly.
