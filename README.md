# Spring Earning/Revenue Converter
A Very Basic Spring Boot Project to convert earnings into various currencies.  
# Download 
You can download the executable files from [this](https://github.com/PrathameshBhagat/Spring-Earning-Revenue-Converter/releases/tag/0.0.1) release.
# Target User
Target users for this project are freelancers, NRIs, working professionals, and even part-time-earning students who want their earnings to be more efficiently overviewed, calculated, and managed. 
# Progress
Currently, this isn't deployed to any server and remains on a local server, but soon it will be deployed to AWS or AZURE cloud servers.
As of now, it relies on stored currency exchange data instead of live currency rates from a third-party API, which will soon be updated.
