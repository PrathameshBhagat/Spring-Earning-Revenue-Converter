# Spring Earning/Revenue Converter
A Very Basic Spring Boot Project to convert earnings into various currencies (currently in development).  
You can get a bunch of currency converters online but **none** with yearly, monthly, daily earnings calculation in different currencies.
# Target User
Target users for this project are freelancers, NRI's, working professionals and even part-time earning students wanting their earning to be more efficiently overviewed, calculated and managed. 
# Progress
Currently this isn't deployed to any server and remains at local server but soon would be delpoyed to AWS/AZURE once frontend and backend is complete.  
This as of now produces only JSON response and relies on stored currency exchange data instead of live currency rates from a third party API which would soon be updated.
#  Outputs 
They are as follows:
