# Spring Earning/Revenue Converter
A Very Basic Spring Boot Project to convert earnings into various currencies.  
# Download 
You can download the executable files from [this](https://github.com/PrathameshBhagat/Spring-Earning-Revenue-Converter/releases/tag/0.0.1) release.
# Progress
As of now, it relies on stored currency exchange data instead of live currency rates from a third-party API, which will soon be updated.
# Converter running on an Amazon AWS EC2 instance
