# Spring Boot Earning/Revenue Converter
Spring Boot Earning/Revenue Converter is a basic Spring Boot project that converts earnings/profits/costs into various currencies divided into different time brackets. It was intended to help OFY Wellness but was put on hold due to the higher priority of the OFY Wellness Android app.

# Downloads
You can download the executable files from [this](https://github.com/PrathameshBhagat/Spring-Earning-Revenue-Converter/releases/tag/0.0.1) release.

# Disadvantages
1. Competitors may have better and faster access to real-time exchange rates, which may question the accuracy of this converter.
2. Usability over Android is questionable as it already has built-in calculators, which provide currency conversion with other features and better integration.
3. Browser extensions that provide the same features with lesser utilization of window space and resources pose strong competition, although this can also be provided as a browser extension.

# Bugs
Issues needed to be handled:
1. It relies on stored currency exchange data instead of live currency rates from a third-party API so no real-time exchange rate consideration.
2. The converter currently needs to be downloaded via a jar file locally and isn't available via a link directly.
3. Convert it into a browser extension or provide its front end as one.
